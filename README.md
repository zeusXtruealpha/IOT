## Tech Stuff 🛠️

Used to build this:

- React.js for the frontend
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ThingSpeak for IoT data storage
- ESP32 for hardware control

## Getting Started 🚀

### What You'll Need
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Analog TDS Sensor
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- Breadboard and connecting wires
- Power supply

### Let's Get It Running!

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeusXtruealpha/IOT.git waterqm
cd waterqm
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Set up ThingSpeak:
1. Create a new ThingSpeak channel
2. Configure your ESP32 with the ThingSpeak API key
3. Update the configuration in your code

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Data Interpretation 📊

Understanding your water quality data:

- EC Values:
  - Below 300 μS/cm: Very pure water
  - 300-600 μS/cm: Good for drinking water
  - Above 900 μS/cm: May require treatment
